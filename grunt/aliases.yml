# Aliases
# The `aliases.yml` file is an artifact of our `load-grunt-config` plugin. Normally we would use `grunt.registerTask()` to chain our smaller tasks into a single command. With `load-grunt-config` we instead define these as YAML lists.

# Default
# This task is used when running `grunt` without any arguments. Since most builds will be for development we'll make this the default.

default:
  - 'clean'
  - 'coffeelint'
  - 'newer:coffee:dev'
  - 'newer:sass:dev'
  - 'copy:fonts'
  - 'copy:libraries'
  - 'copy:templates'
  - 'newer:imagemin'

# Distribution
# This task is for creating a build to be placed on a production server. It includes all of the compilation and optimization tasks, plus makes any necessary configuration changes.
