# Aliases
# The `aliases.yml` file is an artifact of our `load-grunt-config` plugin. Normally we would use `grunt.registerTask()` to chain our smaller tasks into a single command. With `load-grunt-config` we instead define these as YAML lists.

# Default
# This task is used when running `grunt` without any arguments. Since most builds will be for development we'll make this the default.

default:
  - 'clean'
  - 'coffeelint'
  - 'newer:coffee:dev'
  - 'newer:sass:dev'
  - 'newer:copy:fonts'
  - 'newer:copy:libraries'
  - 'newer:copy:templates'
  - 'newer:imagemin'

# Concurrent
# This is currently just a test to see if we can speed up the Grunt build even more by running tasks concurrently. So far it's actually increased our build time. However, I think it'll be beneficial once we have a larger codebase so I'm leaving it in for now.

concurrentTest:
  - 'concurrent:prep'
  - 'concurrent:compilers'
  - 'concurrent:copy'

# Distribution
# This task is for creating a build to be placed on a production server. It includes all of the compilation and optimization tasks, plus makes any necessary configuration changes.

dist:
  - ''

# Server
# We'll use `grunt-concurrent` to run both the `watch` and `connect` tasks, allowing us to automagically recompile any files that we change AND keep a simple server running so we can immediately check out thos changes in the browser.

server:
  - 'concurrent:server'
