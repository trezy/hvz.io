# Gruntfile
# [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is, in its simplest form, a task runner. We'll use our Gruntfile to import our Node `package.json` file *<-why?*, then we'll import our tasks.

module.exports = (grunt) ->
  appNamespace = 'hvz'

  grunt.initConfig
    pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json')

# Tasks
# Tasks in Grunt can do almost *anything*. We'll use them to compile the projects Sass files, compress files for production, and run unit tests. To do this we'll first pass individual types of tasks - i.e. compile Sass, concatenate scripts, etc. - as objects to Grunt's `initConfig` method. Later we'll create more complex tasks by chaining subsets of these original task objects.

# CoffeeLint

    coffeelint:
      options:
        configFile: '.coffeelint'
      app: [
        'coffee/**/*.coffee'
        'coffee/**/*.litcoffee'
      ]

# Connect
# Since we don't need a backend server to run our software, we'll use connect to start up a local server with little effort which uses few resources.

    connect:
      server:
        options:
          base: 'build'
          keepalive: true
          port: 9001

# Copy
# Some of our files don't need to be compiled but we still want to keep them in our project root to maintain separation of concerns. We'll just copy these files directly from the project root to the `build/` folder.

    copy:
      main:
        files: [
          src: 'templates/*'
          dest: 'build/js/'
        ]

# Image Minification
# Since we're already in the business of optimizing everything for bandwidth, we'll keep that trend up with `imagemin`. This task will take all of the images in the `img/` folder and optimize them using any means available. The resulting files will be put end up in `build/img/`.

    imagemin:
      dynamic:
        files: [
          cwd: 'images'
          expand: true
          src: [
            '*.png'
            '*.jpg'
            '*.gif'
          ]
          dest: 'build/img'
        ]

# Sass
# All of our styling is done in Sass so we'll want a task to compile them instead of having to do it manually every time we make a change. We'll break this down further similar to the way we broke down our `coffee` task. Our `sass:dev` task will compile our Sass files to normalized CSS files. Our `sass:build` task will compile our

    sass:
      dev:
        options:
          style: 'expanded'
        files:
          'build/css/app.css': 'scss/global.scss'
      build:
        options:
          style: 'compressed'
        files:
          'build/css/app.css': 'scss/global.scss'

# Watch
# Finally we'll want to set up a `watch` task. This will allow us to watch for changes in any of the files we'll be editing and automagically compile them when we save.

    watch:
      copy:
        files: 'templates/*'
        tasks: 'copy:main'
      img:
        files: 'images/*.{png,jpg,gif}'
        tasks: 'imagemin:dynamic'
      sass:
        files: 'scss/**/*.scss'
        tasks: 'sass:dev'

# Plugins
# We'll need to load all of the plugins for the tasks listed above. We can do this using Grunt's `loadNpmTasks` method.

  grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-coffeelint'
  grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-connect'
  grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-copy'
  grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-imagemin'
  grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-sass'
  grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-watch'

  grunt.registerTask 'build', ['coffeelint:app', 'copy:main', 'sass:dev', 'imagemin:dynamic']
